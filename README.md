This repo contains R code for the paper of the same name. Specifcally this includes the following:

1. Rmarkdown file ALS_cohort_analysis.Rmd which performs the cohort analysis from the paper and the ALS_cohort_analysis.pdf which details the results of the analysis.

2. R files for the simulation study included in the paper in the directory Rscripts. To recreate the simulation the following files are needed:
    1. simJM_data.R - this file performs the mathematically simulation of s single joint longitudinal and time to event dataset.
    2. Gen_sim_data.R - this file uses simJM_data.R to simulated the various datasets used in the simulation study.
    3. Fit_sim_models.R - this file fits Cox models, linear mixed models and joint models to the data generated by Gen_sim_data.R. Cox models and linear mixed models are stored in the directory "Results/Sim_sub-models". Joint models are stored in the directory "Results/Sim_JMs".
    4. Extract_simJM_estimates.R - this file extracts the joint model parameter estimates from the joint models produced by Fit_sim_models.R and performs the calculation of MSE, bias, and coverage reported in the paper.
    5. Extract_simCoxLMM_estimates.R - this file extracts the Cox model and linear mixed model estimates from these sub-models reported in the supplementary data of the paper.
